How to run the program:

1) For the client side, open terminal, type 'cd client', then 'npm install'
2) Once the node modules folder is created, type 'npm start' in the terminal
3) For the server side, open another terminal and type 'npx json-server --watch backend/database.json --port 3001'

All done! You should be able to see and use IMD Resumator :)
